# AtliQ-Hospitality-Revenue-Insight-Analysis
For this project, I used Power BI to design and create the Revenue Insights Dashboard for Hotel Hospitality. With the comprehensive view of key income indicators provided by this dashboard, making data-driven decisions that can result in remarkable success is made possible.

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.

## Task
As a data analyst,  I have been tasked with completing the following task using sample data and a mock-up dashboard. All needed files are available for download in the download section.

•	Create the metrics according to the metrics list. 

•	Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.

•	Create a relevant insight that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.
